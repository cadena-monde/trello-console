Console utilities using the Trello API

The application for now just allows saving all the cards in a board's column to txt.

To use the application first set the **APIKey** and **APPName** constants in **TrelloConsole.cs**.

### Dependencies

This application uses the [Trello.NET][1] client libraries for the Trello API.
